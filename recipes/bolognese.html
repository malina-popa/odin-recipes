        <li>Stir in the mince and cook, breaking up any clumps of meat with a wooden spoon, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato purée, garlic and thyme, and cook for 1-2 mins more.<br>Pour in the wine, if using, and increase the heat to boil off most of the alcohol.<br>Reduce the heat, stir in the stock and season.<br>Cover with a tight-fitting lid and leave to cook gently for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins<br>until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking for 15 mins.<br>Meanwhile, cook the pasta following pack instructions.<br>Reserve a mugful of the cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and add to the ragu with the parmesan.<br>Toss well and add a little pasta water to help the sauce coat the spaghetti.<br>Serve with a side salad and extra cheese, if you like.</li>
