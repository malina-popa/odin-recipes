        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the bolognese sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 onion, halved and finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 celery stick, finely diced</li>
                <li>1 large carrot, finely diced</li>
                <li>600g pack minced beef steak</li>
                <li>3 tbsp tomato purée</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
                <li>2 tsp fresh thyme leaves</li>
                <li>150ml red wine (or use extra beef stock)</li>
                <li>500ml beef stock</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>To season and serve</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>400g spaghetti</li>
                <li>50g grated parmesan, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onion, celery and carrot. Fry over a medium heat for 10 mins, stirring now and then, until softened and starting to colour.</li>
                <li>Stir in the mince and cook, breaking up any clumps of meat with a wooden spoon, until browned.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato purée, garlic and thyme, and cook for 1-2 mins more. Pour in the wine, if using, and increase the heat to boil off most of the alcohol. Reduce the heat, stir in the stock and season. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and leave to cook gently for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking for 15 mins. Meanwhile, cook the pasta following pack instructions. Reserve a mugful of the cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and add to the ragu with the parmesan. Toss well and add a little pasta water to help the sauce coat the spaghetti. Serve with a side salad and extra cheese, if you like.</li>
            </ol>
