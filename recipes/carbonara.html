        <h2>An Italian favourite typical of Lazio and popular all over the world!</h2>
        <p class="fancy-desc">Pasta carbonara is an indulgent yet surprisingly simple recipe.<br>Made with pancetta (or bacon) and plenty of pecorino cheese, this recipe takes only 30 minutes to prepare from start to finish!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>100g pancetta</li>
                <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
                <li>50g parmesan</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>350g spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
                <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
                <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.<br>Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
                <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil,<br>cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
                <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
                <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.<br>Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
                <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.<br>The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
                <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low.<br>When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.<br>Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
                <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
                <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese.<br>Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture,<br>which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
                <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).<br>You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
                <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl.<br>Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.<br>If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="tips"><i><b>Tip: </b>Pasta water can be dripped in as you transfer the spaghetti to the hot frying pan. Everything mingles to make a light, silky smooth sauce!</i></p>
